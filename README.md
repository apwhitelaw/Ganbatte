# Ganbatte
Ganbatte is a app designed for use with the WaniKani website that offers an Anki style review system,
meaning instead of typing in your answers, it will simply display the answer and you will say whether
or not you got it right. The original idea for the app came when I was searching for a good iOS app to
that I could make to display my coding abilities, but also along the way I found that I wanted a faster
way to complete the reviews, since I would build up so many and struggle to complete them.

### WaniKani
WaniKani is a website designed for learning Japanes kanji and vocabulary. It consists of 60 levels and
each level contains new kanji for you to learn, as well as associated vocabulary. WaniKani is a 
subscription service, and therefore this app is only available to those who subscribe. WaniKani
does offer the first few levels free, so you are welcome to try out the service with this app.
